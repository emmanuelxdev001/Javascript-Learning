â€¢ CLASS OBJECTIVES
1. If and Else
2. Tenary Operators

IF and ELSE OVERVIEW.
The if and else is a type of conditional statement that will execute a block of code when the condition in the if statement is truthy. If the condition is falsy, then the else block will be executed.

Truthy and falsy values are converted to true or false in if statements.

false
0 (zero)
-0 (negative zero)
0n (BigInt zero)
"", '', ```` (empty string)
null
undefined
NaN (not a number)

TENARY OPERATOR OVERVIEW.
The ternary operator is a shorter way to perform conditional checks in JavaScript.

*JAVASCRIPT ASSIGNMENT 1.*
*If and Else* Questions

*ALL Questions should be solved using if and else conditional statements javascript *

1. **Spread Operator Task**: Spread the `students` array into a new array called `studentsCopy` using the spread operator.

2. **Alice's Submission Status**: Write a program that checks if **Alice** has submitted her assignment. If she has, output "Alice has submitted her assignment". If not, output "Alice has not submitted her assignment".

3. **Bob's Membership Privilege**: Write a program that checks if **Bob** has a "gold" or "platinum" membership. If he does, output "Bob has Priority Grading". If not, output "Bob has Standard Grading".

4. **Charlie's Subject Recognition**: Write a program that checks the `submittedSubject` of **Charlie**. If the subject is "Math", output "Charlie is a Math Genius". If it is "Science", output "Charlie is a Science Star". Otherwise, output "Charlie, Keep Up the Good Work".

5. **David's Membership Downgrade**: Write a program that checks if **David** hasn't submitted his assignment. If he hasn't, reduce his membership level by one tier (e.g., "gold" to "silver"). If he has, output "David has no penalty".

6. **Eve's Extra Credit**: Write a program that checks if **Eve** submitted a "Math" assignment and has a "gold" or "platinum" membership. If both conditions are true, give Eve extra credit.

7. **Frank's Science Fair Eligibility**: Write a program that checks if **Frank** submitted a "Science" assignment and if his membership is "silver" or higher. If both are true, Frank is eligible for the Science Fair.

8. **Grace's Badge Reward**: Write a program that checks if **Grace** has submitted her assignment. If she has, reward her with a badge based on her membership level.

9. **Heidi's Detailed Feedback**: Write a program that checks if **Heidi** submitted a "History" assignment. If she did, and her membership is "gold" or higher, provide her with a detailed feedback report.

10. **Ivan's Membership Upgrade**: Write a program that checks if **Ivan** has a "bronze" membership and has submitted his assignment. If both conditions are true, upgrade his membership to "silver".

11. **Judy's STEM Award**: Write a program that checks if **Judy** has submitted a "Science" or "Math" assignment and has a membership of at least "silver". If both conditions are true, award her a "STEM Excellence" certificate.



*JAVASCRIPT ASSIGNMENT 2.*
*Tenary Operator* Questions

*ALL Questions should be solved using Tenary Operator conditional statements javascript*

*ALL Console.Logs MUST be in String/Template Literals unless not Necessary for a specific question*

1. **Check if there is a student with the name "Chinedu Okafor" and a score greater than 80. If so, log a message with the student's name and indicate that their score is "A". Otherwise, log a message saying no student with this name and score was found.**

2. **Check if there is a student studying "English" with a score greater than 90. If so, log a message with the student's name and indicate that their score is "A". Otherwise, log a message saying no student studying English with this score was found.**

3. **Check if there is a student with the name "Emeka Nwosu" or if there is any student with a score greater than 75. If "Emeka Nwosu" is found, log a message with their name and indicate that their score is "A". If not, but a student with a score greater than 75 is found, log a message indicating that this student's score is above 75. Otherwise, log a message saying no relevant student was found.**

4. **Check if there is any student whose subject is "History" with a score greater than 85, or if any student has a score greater than 90. If a student with the "History" subject and score criteria is found, log a message with their name and indicate that their score is "A". If not, but a student with a score above 90 is found, log a message with their name and indicate that their score is above 90. Otherwise, log a message saying no relevant student was found.**

5. **Check if there is a student with a score of exactly 95 or if the student's name is "Ifeanyi Eze". If "Ifeanyi Eze" is found, log a message with their name and indicate that their score is "A". If not, but a student with a score of exactly 95 is found, log a message with their name and indicate that their score is exactly 95. Otherwise, log a message saying no relevant student was found.**
