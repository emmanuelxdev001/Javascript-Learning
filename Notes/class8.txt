â€¢ CLASS OBJECTIVES
1. Template Literals
2. Spread Operator

TEMPLATE LITERALS OVERVIEW.
Template literals are a feature in JavaScript that allow for easier string creation, including embedding expressions and multi-line strings. They are enclosed by backticks (`) instead of the traditional single (') or double (") quotes.
Embed expressions within a string using ${expression} syntax.


SPREAD OPERATOR Operator OVERVIEW.

The spread operator (...) in JavaScript allows an iterable (like an array or object) to be expanded 

Copying Arrays/Objects: Create a shallow copy of an array or object.

Merging Arrays/Objects: Combine multiple arrays or objects into one.

Expanding Arrays: Pass elements of an array as individual arguments to a function.

Adding/Modifying Properties: Add or modify properties in an object when copying.

*JS ASSIGNMENT*

1. *Using the JavaScript spread operator, create a duplicate of the `company` array of objects. Use this duplicate to attempt the rest of the questions.*

2. *print out on the console the names of all managers across all companies, concatenated into a single string.*

3. *calculate and print out the total number of staff members across all departments and companies.*

4. *print out on the console the first department where any staff member holds the position "Strategist".*

5. *print out on the console whether all departments in "Creative Solutions LLC" have managers whose names contain the word "Green"*













Here is the updated list with questions 2 and 6 removed and the remaining questions renumbered:

1. **Using the JavaScript spread operator, create a duplicate of the `company` array of objects. Use this duplicate to attempt the rest of the questions.**

2. **Using the JavaScript `flatMap` and `map` array methods, print out on the console the names of all managers across all companies, concatenated into a single string.**

3. **Using the JavaScript `map` and `reduce` array methods, calculate and print out the total number of staff members across all departments and companies.**

4. **Using the JavaScript `filter`, `some`, and `find` array methods, print out on the console the first department where any staff member holds the position "Strategist".**

5. **Using the JavaScript `map`, `filter`, and `every` array methods, print out on the console whether all departments in "Creative Solutions LLC" have managers whose names contain the word "Green".**
